Well here it goes! My first blog post. 

Well I should clarify, this is my first personal blog post. We have all had to do that one assignment for class writing them, but this one is now for me. Living in quarentine provides a bit more free time (as everyone knows) to pursue side projects, and I have always wanted to start my own website. 

I'm not sure the reality of the situation has settled in yet. I feel as if I'm spending one more week-long break from school at home before hopping back on the plane from DC to Boston, and I can't quite process that living here in Oakton, Virginia is my reality for the upcoming months. Not because I don’t like Northern Virginia, trust me, I’ll be the first to profess my love for the DM[V]. But when I think about how I'm still in college, I imagine I'll return to Cambridge, stop by Blackbird donuts in Smith Campus center for a coffee, and resume my life as a college student in Lowell House. Yet the phrase I keep repeating to myself to snap out of this thought process is, "College life is over." While yes, I have the friends, memories, *future* diploma, etc, I have to remind myself that I will most likely never live in Cambridge/Boston again, I'll never give another tour as an undergraduate tour guide, I won't be attending a packed, sweaty dorm party, and I will not walk into class with my backpack ready for lecture. 

Yet as I mentioned, those thoughts only bubble up when I focus on the situation itself—being pushed from campus during my senior spring. My resting mental state however is more neutral. I am fortunate to have access to outdoors and high school best friends to see (while remaining socially distant), as well a region that's not too affected by the pandemic itself (we’re not under total quarantine). I think the most difficult sentiment to grapple with is the idea of productivity, especially in those flash moments of realizing I have ~2 months of college left at home in Virginia. 

I struggle trying to accept the idea that this is a time to rest, recover, and relax while also seeing this vast amount of free time as a once in a life time opportunity to be my most productive self without the limitations of clubs, classes, and/or travel to get in the way. As students we are taught to maximize efficiency and productivity, and when met with 3 months of forced “emptiness,” there is seemingly infinite potential for creation and work on our own terms before entering the “real world.” 

The first thing I did upon arriving home was draft a "To Do Project" list outlining all of the things I wanted to accomplish in these next two months. There's an art project I want to finish; I want to start a blog (here we are; yay for progress), but I also put on actions like exercise, cook, journal, etc. I now realize that setting this almost chore like list, is me asking myself to be the most productive, self optimizing version not only in school work, but also in self care and. I suddenly realized that my art project and journals started to feel like chores, because I assumed that since I now had the time, I must make the most of it to produce the best version of myself. I think in catching this though process as well as writing about it here, I’m able to take a step in dismantling that endless need for productivity in order to free myself and my time up to pursue projects with a more natural drive. In doing so, I believe my end result will be both more meaningful and higher quality. 

I’ll admit this is a very inner-looking reflection and issue especially given all that is going on in the world. But overall I have realized I should take this time to start reflecting on experiences or thought processes like this one. Thus rather than self-improvement through a to-do list, I think this sort of reflection will be more impactful and beneficial. Stay updated with me on this journey!
